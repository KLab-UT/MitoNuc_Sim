  William and I identified 3 primary problems to solve for this project:
	1- Splitting population into sexually reproducing and asexually reproducing lineages
	2- Create two interacting chromosomes where one can recombine and the other can't
		NOTE: This is the way it will be in the sexually reproducing populations. 
	              In the asex repro pops both won't be able to recombine
	3- Create a measure of fitness from the interaction between the two chromosomes created in 2
  
  This week William will address problem 1 above. He will create a SLiM script that:
	- Starts with a single population
	- Runs for 1000 generations
	- Splits off a subpopulation
	- Sets the new subpopulation as asexually reproducing (using methods in SLiM)
	- Run for 1000 more generations
