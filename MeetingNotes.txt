  William figured out how to: (A) create scenario where a divergence event leads to an asexually-reproducing lineage and a sexually reproducing lineage and (B) set up the Muller's ratchet scenario.
  So, problem 1 (described in January 24 meeting notes) is solved!
  -- He actually created three populations: (1) Multiple-mate sexually-reproducing lineage, (2) Selfing sexually-reproducing lineage, and (3) Clonal lineage.
  -- The simulation shows an interesting interaction between repro mode and population size over time
  THIS WEEK: William will read through section 14.5 to see if modeling the Y chromosome wiht psuedo-autosomal regions could be co-opted to model the mitochondrion. The challenge is making sure the mito portion gets inherited by 100% of the offspring (which doesn't occur with the Y chromosome) while still only being transferred by a single parent. However, for now it is okay if the "mito" region is biparentally inherited and simply is a region where no recombination happens.

  William and I identified 3 primary problems to solve for this project:
	1- Splitting population into sexually reproducing and asexually reproducing lineages
	2- Create two interacting chromosomes where one can recombine and the other can't
		NOTE: This is the way it will be in the sexually reproducing populations. 
	              In the asex repro pops both won't be able to recombine
	3- Create a measure of fitness from the interaction between the two chromosomes created in 2
  
  This week William will address problem 1 above. He will create a SLiM script that:
	- Starts with a single population
	- Runs for 1000 generations
	- Splits off a subpopulation
	- Sets the new subpopulation as asexually reproducing (using methods in SLiM)
	- Run for 1000 more generations

  William installed ubuntu and cloned the git repository
  This week he will work through the rest of Chapter 4 and move into 5.2.3
  For next week: Show William how to push to main branch and write out project objectives in detail (in ReadMe.md)
